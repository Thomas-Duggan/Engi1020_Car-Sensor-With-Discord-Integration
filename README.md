## Notes
- Project in collaboration with Devin Reardon.
- "CFW" means Custom FirmWare. I do not have permission to distribute the CFW used.
- Both programs with a preceeding "!" are to be ran seperately in different instances of Thonny (or different IDE), simultaneously.
- Requires a microcomputer and [Ultrasonic Ranger](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Ultrasonic_Ranger/) to function properly.


## Purpose

A replacement for internal car alarms with the addition to check temperature values wirelessly.


## Issues

- Can print "Check Vehicle" several times even after the user turns the system off
